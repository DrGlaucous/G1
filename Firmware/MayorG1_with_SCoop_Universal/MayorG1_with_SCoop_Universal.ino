//Control Firmware for the Mayor G1 by Dr_Glaucous -2022

//written in VisualMicro (Visual studio 2019 + vMicro plugin)


//this program aims to be a generic solution for controlling arduino based "smart" nerf blasters that use brushless flywheel control
//so far, the program adds variable flywheel speed, pusher speed, and 4 fire modes to the host blaster
//In terms of hardware, any generic atmel (arduino variant) should be able to run it, providing it has the required number of I/O
//
//In order to tailor the program to fit your controller's needs (if you used different pinout when building your blaster),
//please consult the Configuration.h file to adjust the program accordingly
//





//Nothing codey here: see Main.cpp for the root program
